GOLDEN RULE:
NEVER HAVE MORE THAN 10 ACTIVE TODOS

ACTIVE (NEVER HAVE MORE THAN 10):
6) make logs file
8) make a staging buffer checker thing


FUTURE:
None


PREVIOUS:
1) change mmap to fopen, I tested and the speeds are the same. Fopen is more portable.
4) figure out what to do with 'loader' directoy (probably delete);
2) use stat not fseek
3) make it easy to enumerate directory entires;
5) memory available can be less than file size.
7) if i am going to be stat and fstat just use open and not fopen
9) get xattr with path is fastest
10) maybe save get xaddr but it might not be worth it tbh
