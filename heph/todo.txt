GOLDEN RULE:
NEVER HAVE MORE THAN 10 ACTIVE TODOS

ACTIVE (NEVER HAVE MORE THAN 10):
2) use stat not fseek
3) make it easy to enumerate directory entires;
4) figure out what to do with 'loader' directoy (probably delete);
5) memory available can be less than file size.
6) make logs file


FUTURE:
None


PREVIOUS:
1) change mmap to fopen, I tested and the speeds are the same. Fopen is more portable.
