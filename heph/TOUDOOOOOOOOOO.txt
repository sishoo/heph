instead of keeping a vertex buffer std vector maybe just have a thing that keep ptrs

read the file into the mapped memory


make gpu hash table


Make a 'big vec' template thing.
A bottleneck with the model loading or 'dynamic' model loading is that now we essentially have to reallocate ALL THE MESHES when we want 
to add some
add a feature where you can preallocate;



PAST OBJECTIVES:


USE THE MULTIPLE FILES ITS ACTAULLT FASTER

HOLD UP MEMORY MAPPED FILES BOMBOCLASD
REMOVE THE LOADER MAKE IT SO THAT YOU JUST HAVE THE FREAKING BUFFERS
