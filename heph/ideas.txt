coarse frustum culling on cpu with giga quad tree

have a global hash table and a "point hash" where the point in the quadtree has a hash and the 
creatures data is in the hash table. maybe also have a reverse where there is an adjacency list and the hash
table holds the index and you can directly go to the quadtree node


in the quad tree have the count also be a bit thing that tells you which of the children survives
00
01
10
11
the order of them tells you the order of the offset from child ptr
